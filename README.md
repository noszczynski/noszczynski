## ‚öôÔ∏è Projects

### Plenti

The project has been developed by several people, including myself, for many years. It is a platform for renting consumer electronics of various kinds - drones, consoles, computers, smartphones and others. On my side for many years was the development and maintenance of the Plenti's website, mobile apps (iOS and Android) and admin panel.
